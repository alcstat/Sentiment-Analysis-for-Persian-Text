# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Persian-Text
Sentiment Analysis is a process in which the polarity (positive or negative) of a given text (comment, tweets, etc.) is determined. In this project, I have performed sentiment analysis for Persian text by multiple methodologoes(Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Vector Space Models) in R.
